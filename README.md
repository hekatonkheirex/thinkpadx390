## Before installation note
*You can review the `pkglist.txt` file to remove the packages you don't want and replace the ones you like, but I cannot guarantee if don't work as expected. Please, read the disclaimer*

## Installation
1. Do a fresh Arch Linux installation. *Remember to install `git` package during installation*. *You can also install on your existing installation, just skip to section 5*.
2. Install `paru`. *You can install whatever version you like, I prefer the binary version*. *You can also use whatever AUR helper you want, but remeber to uninstall `paru` at the end of the installation or remove the `paru-bin` line inside the `pkglist.txt` file*  
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
cd paru-bin
makepkg -si
```  
3. Fork this repository or download it.  
4. If you forked it, use [yadm](https://yadm.io/) to download your forked repo.
  ```
  yadm clone https://github.com/youruser/yourforkedrepo.git
  ```  
5. If you downloaded it or cloned it, copy everything to your home directory (all the .config and .local directory, and all the *" . "* files as well).
6. Use `paru` (or the AUR helper of choice) to install everything in the `pkglist.txt` file. *You can use `pacman` too, but it won't install the AUR packages*.
```
paru -S --needed - < pkglist.txt
```
